# 35Days Roadmap to AWS-CLF-C02

### Server composed with below :
* CPU + RAM =  Brain *(When we think of something we are doing computation like CPU and then we have to remember that which is like storing data in RAM)*
* Storage
* Database
* Network 

### Section 3 - What is cloud Computing
#### Traditional IT Overview 
* Before, company would work like this: 
    * Buy servers and other equipement for data center
    * Pay rent for data center
    * Hire maintaiance guy for server

* Disadvantage
    * Hard to scale (Intense time consuming) -> if need to add server, have to do following: 
       ```markdown
        order it -> install OS and configuration -> dedicate a physical space 
        ```

-----   
### Cloud Computing
*   On-demand Delivery of you get it when you need it (computer powert, db storage, applications and other IT resources)
*   Pay as you go feature
* Access resources as you need, almost instantly

#### Depployment Models of the Cloud
* Private Cloud : Not exposed to internet, still maintained by third party like rackspace (Not important for exam)
* Public : aws, azure, google cloud
* Hybrid : Some resource in on-prem and some on public cloud like aws

#### Five Characteristics
*   On-demand self service
* Broad network access
* Multi-tenancy and resouce pooling: Resources Shared with other customer still everyone having their own security and privacy and not affecting each other
*   Rapid Elasticity and scalability

#### Six Advantages 
* CAPEX(Trade Capital expense) for Operational expense (OPEX) : Hardware not owned , only rent for operation
* No need to guess usage as cloud can scale .
* Benefit from massive economies of scale : Huge customer base so cost for AWS is less to rent it's resource to users
* Increase speed and agility
* No cost to maintain and run datacenter
* Go Global in minutes

#### Problems solved by cloud
 * Flexibility
 * Cost-Effective
 * Elasticity : Add more or reduce resources as needed on real-time - **Short term effect**
 * Scalability : If anticiated to have large volume of load we can increasing system power(more computation power, increase RAM) or add more resources like server  - **Long Term effect**
 * High-avaliability and fault-tolerance

 ### Types of Cloud Computing

* **Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas)** ->  Raw resource - More flexibility also more responsibility 
-> eg :  Lego blocks, we have to build different shapes as we need
*  **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**  -> Limited flexibility but little less responsibility -> 
 eg :  Lego blocks whose base are prebuilt for us, we need to add the remaining part to complete
* **Software as a Service (SaaS)** -> no resposibility->  eg:  Lego blocks that are in fully built set in wide range of options for us to pick and play.
