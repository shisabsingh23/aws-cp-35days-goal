# 35Days Roadmap to AWS-CLF-C02

### Server composed with below :
* CPU + RAM =  Brain *(When we think of something we are doing computation like CPU and then we have to remember that which is like storing data in RAM)*
* Storage
* Database
* Network 

### Section 3 - What is cloud Computing
#### Traditional IT Overview 
* Before, company would work like this: 
    * Buy servers and other equipement for data center
    * Pay rent for data center
    * Hire maintaiance guy for server

* Disadvantage
    * Hard to scale (Intense time consuming) -> if need to add server, have to do following: 
       ```markdown
        order it -> install OS and configuration -> dedicate a physical space 
        ```
